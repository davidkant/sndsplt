###todo

- since we need to pass around all this stuff en env structue would be really nice.
or you just make it an object that stores that stuff once. and you call methods on it.
i don't really like that tho...

- should prbs just init the classifier once

- you should write down the dimensions somewhere

- make the list of stuff look nicer, and all input params
