###todo

- since we need to pass around all this stuff en env structue would be really nice.
or you just make it an object that stores that stuff once. and you call methods on it.
i don't really like that tho...

- should prbs just init the classifier once

- you should write down the dimensions somewhere

- make the list of stuff look nicer, and all input params

- example of multiple sources

- print logprob and sparsity on Z to optimize num components

- plotters

- add how long it took to print statement

- batch file input

- maybe info .txt should we exactly same as batch file input YEAH!

- params should be a feature params object i think
